Description: Cell clustering is one of the most important and commonly performed tasks in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. 
            An important step in cell clustering is to select a subset of genes (referred to as “features”), whose expression patterns will then 
            be used for downstream clustering. A good set of features should include the ones that distinguish different cell types, 
            and the quality of such set could have significant impact on the clustering accuracy. 
            FEAST is an R library for selecting most representative features before performing the core of scRNA-seq clustering. It can be used 
            as a plug-in for the etablished clustering algorithms such as SC3, TSCAN, SHARP, SIMLR, and Seurat. 
            The core of FEAST algorithm includes three steps:
            1. consensus clustering;
            2. gene-level significance inference;
            3. validation of an optimized feature set.
